Stylesheet: Utilites Styles

We put all the form and button styles in here to setup a consistent
look. If we need to customize them, we can do this in the main
stylesheets and just override them. Easy Peasy.

You're gonna see a few data-uri thingies down there. If you're not
sure what they are, check this link out:

If you want to create your own, use this helpful link:
